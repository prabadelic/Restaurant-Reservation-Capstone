This is a **Full-stack application project** called [**Restaurant Reservation System**](https://restaurant-reservation-capstone-1.onrender.com/), built to manage and optimize restaurant reservations and table management. The backend is a **RESTful API** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**, while the frontend is developed using **React** and styled with **Bootstrap**. The system enables restaurant staff to handle reservations, manage tables, and ensure efficient seating arrangements.
